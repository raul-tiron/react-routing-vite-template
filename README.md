# React Routing Vite Template
## This is a template for a React app using **React Router**, **Vite** and **Material UI**.

### It contains a Header template, a Footer one, some page templates, such as:

1. A **blog** page.

2. A **home** page.

3. A **contact** page.

4. An **about** page.

5. A **services** page.

# To be able to use it, you will have to do some preparation:

First, of course, get the template.
After that, you will have to get the **node_modules** folder,
which contains everything that the **React App** needs to run.

To do that, just run:

> **npm i** or **npm install**.

**React Router** and **Material UI** will automatically be installed <br>
as they are found in the template, and **Vite** is already set up.

After that, also run:

> **npm install -D prettier eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-prettier eslint-plugin-react-hooks**.

If you are questioning what these are, **Prettier** is a code formatter to make your code look more beautiful,
and **ESLint** is a static code analysis tool for identifying problematic patterns found in JavaScript code.

In the template, you will find an **.eslintrc** and a **.prettierrc** file.
Those are just the configs for Prettier and ESLint, to help you write the best code possible
and if you don't know what you're doing you are better off not messing with them.

You will see that, for example, when you save your code (usually by **Ctrl + S**):
> 1. when you import a **hook**, a space will be added between it and the brackets
> or
> 2. a **Semicolon (;)** will be added wherever it's needed because this is ***best practice***
> and you should always write your code like this.
 
Also, you don't have to add **import React from 'react';** to your files, as it is already imported into the **main.jsx** file.
You also have an **index.css** and a **main.css** file that you can freely mess with.

# Now, to start the app,
 all you have to do is run: **npm run dev** and the app will be started. 
You will get a link that you have to access to see the app which looks something like: **http://localhost:5173/**. 

## From here on, you are free to use the template to your liking.

# Some useful information, if you didn't know it already:
> React is a library, made by Facebook, for building interactive UIs (User Interfaces).
>
> Although React is a **SPA** (Single Page Application), you can have multiple pages, using **React Router**,
> as it injects content into the **index.html** file.
> 
> **Material UI** is an open-source component library for React.
>
> **npm** stands for Node Package Manager, used, for example to create apps and install libraries.
> 
> **Vite** "is a build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects." (from their website). <br>
